Programs using Juptyer, python, pandas, plotly, and numpy to visualize the data collected from the Shell Eco Marathon Telemetry System. 
Notes:
- Telemetry reffrence: https://telemetry.sem-app.com/wiki/doku.php/telemetry_data/channel_descriptions
- I would recommend using VSCODE with plugins rather than JuptyerLab. It's just genrally less confusing and runs better.

Todos:
- make an automated script to select the most recent data set/ combine data sets and output the graphs in a more readable way
- actually learn python.
